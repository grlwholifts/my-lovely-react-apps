Tryna learn react bcz atoms in my life don't.

## Dear Github Repository, today I learnt : 

### Day 1
- the difference between ES5 and ES6 versions (contstructor/function method)
- what is babel.js, webpack, ESlint
- added node-modules, presets and plugins for development environment
- converted a file from ES5 to ES6 using babel.js
- couldn't update package.json, will try tomorrow

### Day 2
- how to set up my first react component using CDN, `production.min.js` and `babel standalone` on my local host
- syntax of JSX, refers to JS + XML
- working of `state()` and `render()` functions
- inside `state()`: define properties of the UI, similiar to a class object properties in a basic JS class
- inside `render()`: using `div` to wrap whole JS code, JS code used for dyanamic input like `{ i am a dyanamic input }`
- rendered the react DOM component by wrapping it in a `div`
- learned the scope of `this` reference in the class
- added events to the component using `arrow functions` and event variable
- monitored the working of code using React Developer Tools add-on in Firefox 70
