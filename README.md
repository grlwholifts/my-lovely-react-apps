Tryna learn react bcz atoms in my life don't.

## Dear Github Repository, today I learnt : 

### Day 1
- the difference between ES5 and ES6 versions (constructor/function method)
- what is `babel.js`, `webpack`, `ESlint`
- added `node-modules`, presets and plugins for local development environment (not using official React Environment by Facebook as of now)
- converted a file `main.js` from ES5 to ES6 as `output.js` using babel transpiler
- couldn't update `package.json` tho :P

### Day 2
- how to set up my first react component using CDN, `react.production.min.js`, `react-dom.production.min.js` and `babel standalone` on my local host
- syntax of JSX, refers to JS + XML
- working of `state` and `render()` functions
- inside `state`: define properties of the UI, similiar to a class object properties in a basic JS class
- inside `render()`: using `div` to wrap whole JS code, JS code used for dyanamic input like `{ i am a dyanamic input }`
- rendered the react DOM component by wrapping it in a `div`
- using `setState` to handle state in DOM events
- learned the scope of `this` reference in the class
- added events to the component using `arrow functions` and event variable
- monitored the working of code using React Developer Tools add-on in Firefox 70 

#### Resources for Day:

- [ https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html ]

### Day 3
- introduction to forms in React, defining `input` types, buttons and responsiveness to the UI
- preventing default action for a DOM event using `preventDefault()` function in JS, hence defining our own actions or response to the console
- defining property/attribute to the whole form instead of the single button i.e. responding for both [ if a user clicks on `submit` button ] and [ user presses `enter` key ]
